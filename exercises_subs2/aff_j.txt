Write a program that takes a string, and displays the first 'j' character it
encounters in it, followed by a newline. If there are no 'j' characters in the
string, the program diplays 'j' followed by a newline. If the number of parameters is not
1, the program displays 'j' followed by a newline.

Example:

$> ./aff_j "abc" | cat -e
j$
$> ./aff_j 'RaInB0w d4Sh!' | cat -e
j$
$> ./aff_j 'ThE C4k3 Is a L|3' | cat -e
j$
$> ./aff_j 'C0cOnUt 0N th3 b3AcH' | cat -e
j$
$> ./aff_j | cat -e
j$
    -e
