Write a program that takes a single string as an argument and applies a basic
run-length encoding algorithm.

The input string contains only uppercase letters (Aâ€“Z),
with no character repeated more than 9 times consecutively.

The RLE algorithm compresses sequences of the same character by replacing them
with the number of repetitions followed by the character.

If the string is empty or if the number of arguments is not 1, display a \n.

If a character appears once, don't print the count (just the character).

Examples:

$> ./rle "AAABBC" | cat -e
3A2BC$
$> ./rle "ABCD" | cat -e
ABCD$
$> ./rle "" | cat -e
$
$> ./rle | cat -e
