Write a program that takes one string and displays the characters with each first
letter of each word in uppercase followed by a newline (\n) on the standard output.

If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays a newline (\n).

A "word" is defined as part of a string delimited by spaces, or by the start/end
of the string.


Exemples:

$>./title "pgjqwgjpwoqgejowgqw" | cat -e
Pgjqwgjpwoqgejowgqw$
$>./title 'no no no no!!!!!' | cat -e
No No No No!!!!!$
$>./title "one" "two" | cat -e
$
$>./title
$
$>

with the number of repetitions followed by the character.

If the string is empty or if the number of arguments is not 1, display a \n.

If a character appears once, don't print the count (just the character).

Examples:

$> ./rle "AAABBC" | cat -e
3A2BC$
$> ./rle "ABCD" | cat -e
ABCD$
$> ./rle "" | cat -e
$
$> ./rle | cat -e
